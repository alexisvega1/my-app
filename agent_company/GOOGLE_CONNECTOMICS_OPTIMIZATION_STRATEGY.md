# Google Connectomics Team Optimization Strategy
## High-Impact Approaches for Maximum Impressiveness


### Executive Summary

> **Interview‑Ready Addendum — Robust, Production‑Shaped Pipeline**
>
> This addendum converts the strategy into a concrete, measurable plan that mirrors how Google Connectomics runs petascale pipelines. It emphasizes reproducibility, quality metrics, cost/throughput SLOs, and deterministic reprocessing.

## North‑Star & SLOs (what “robust” means)
- **Image scale**: ≤8×8×30 nm EM; <3% missing tiles; montage median residual < **1 px**.
- **Segmentation quality**: **VI_split ≤ 0.3**, **VI_merge ≤ 0.3** on blinded cubes; Adapted Rand ↑.
- **Synapses**: **Precision/Recall ≥ 0.90/0.90** with graph consistency checks.
- **Ops**: reprocess any **256³ ROI in <24 h**, sustained reconstruction **≥10 mm³/week** (→ ≥100 mm³/month by scale‑up).
- **Human‑time**: **minutes/mm³ ≤ 30** (≤15 at scale) via active‑learning proofreading.
- **Cost**: track **$ per mm³** and **GB per mm³** by tier (hot/warm/cold) with quarterly reduction targets.

## Architecture (end‑to‑end, production‑shaped)
1) **Ingest & Storage**
   - Object storage (S3/GCS) in **Neuroglancer precomputed/TensorStore**; chunk 128³ with 2‑voxel halos; multi‑mip pyramids.
   - NVMe hot caches; erasure‑coded warm; Glacier/tape cold.
   - **Immutable namespaces**: `/raw/vN`, `/stitched/vN`, `/normalized/vN`, `/segments/vN`, `/synapses/vN`.
2) **Montage/Registration/Normalization**
   - Feature + phase‑corr, global solver with loop‑closure; elastic warp (B‑spline); banding/illumination normalization.
   - QC: residual histograms, intensity drift, % rescans.
3) **Segmentation (FFN++)**
   - Long‑context assist (low‑res 3D channel), topology‑aware losses to suppress merges, multi‑agent growth with boundary ID reconciliation.
   - Deterministic chunking/merging; checkpoint every 256³; spot‑friendly.
4) **Synapse Detection & Partner Assignment**
   - UNet/Transformer + triplet consistency; export evidence patches/logits; build point/edge layers.
5) **Skeletons/Mesh/Graph**
   - Kimimaro/meshparty; region parcellations; edge‑correctness metrics.
6) **Proofreading at Scale**
   - Active‑learning triage; skeleton‑first edits; micro‑tasks; **minutes/mm³** logger.
7) **Lineage & Observability**
   - Signed **manifests** (code SHA, params, container digests, checksums). OpenTelemetry traces; Prometheus/Grafana for Mvox/s, cache hit %, retries, $/mm³.

## Quality & Metrics (how we prove it works)
- **Segmentation**: VI_split/VI_merge, ARI; merge‑alarm rate; seam consistency tests.
- **Synapses**: PR curves vs truth; partner accuracy.
- **Ops**: throughput (Mvox/s, mm³/week), reprocess SLA, retry rates, determinism (hash‑stable outputs).
- **Human**: minutes/mm³ (median, p95); error taxonomy.

## Benchmarks & Acceptance Tests
- **Montage**: on a 1024×1024×128 stack → median residual <1 px; drift <5% after normalization.
- **Segmentation**: 3 blinded 256³ cubes → **VI_total** improves ≥15–25% with long‑context + topology loss vs baseline.
- **Synapses**: PR ≥0.85/0.85 (v1), ≥0.90/0.90 (v2) on held‑out truth.
- **Throughput**: 1024³ inference <30 min on 1×A100; end‑to‑end 5–10 mm³/week on small cluster.
- **Reprocess**: any 256³ ROI → stitched→normalized→segments→synapses **<24 h**, outputs bit‑identical across retries.

## 90‑Day → 6‑Month Roadmap (deliverables that impress)
- **Month 1**: Data plane (precomputed/TensorStore), Neuroglancer layers, CRC checksums; proofreading API with **minutes/mm³**. *Demo*: 512³ end‑to‑end.
- **Month 2**: Montage/elastic/normalize + QC dashboards; lineage manifests. *Goal*: residual <1 px.
- **Month 3**: FFN++ baseline + Ray chunk scheduler; deterministic merges; VI harness. *Goal*: 1024³ <30 min infer.
- **Month 4**: Long‑context input + topology loss; Synapse v1; PR ≥0.85. *Goal*: ≥15% VI_total improvement.
- **Month 5**: Proofreading at scale; active‑learning triage; reprocess CLI (256³ <24 h). *Goal*: minutes/mm³ ≤45.
- **Month 6**: 10–30 mm³ dataset with dashboards (VI/PR/throughput/cost); publish slabs + secure enclave for raw. *Goal*: ≥5 mm³/week sustained.

## Risk Register & Mitigations
- **Merge leaks** → topology losses, global context, merge‑alarm heuristics, randomized traversal.
- **IO bottlenecks** → NVMe caches, read coalescing, chunk prefetch, compression on warm/cold tiers.
- **Proofreading drag** → skeleton‑first tools, micro‑tasks, gold sets, time‑boxing; track minutes/mm³.
- **Cost spikes** → spot‑heavy with checkpointing; autoscaling caps; per‑stage $ budget with auto‑abort.
- **Reproducibility gaps** → immutable namespaces, manifests, deterministic operators, hash checks.

## Interview Demo Checklist (show, don’t tell)
- Neuroglancer link/screenshot (raw, GT, prediction layers).
- VI & synapse PR table (baseline vs +context vs +topology).
- Lineage manifest JSON (code SHA, params, checksums) for one ROI.
- Reprocess run log for a 256³ ROI (start→finish <24 h).
- Dashboard snapshot: Mvox/s, retries, minutes/mm³, $/mm³.

> **Note on claims**: Replace generic “100–1000×” statements with stage‑specific, verifiable targets (e.g., montage 2–3×, segmentation 1.2–2×, IO 2–5×, proofreading 2–3×). This reads credible to Google reviewers and aligns with how they evaluate impact.
